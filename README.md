# zillow-public-data
A simple repo which downloads Zillow's public data (no API access required!) and provides some na√Øve visualization

# Why?
As a first time home buyer data was an important factor for me. Getting Zillow's data was not too hard, but getting it all was a bit teadious. The juypter notebook `download.ipynb` is an attempt to automate the download process. Zillow updates their data monthly and more details (or for manual downloads) you can take a look (here)[https://www.zillow.com/research/data/]
